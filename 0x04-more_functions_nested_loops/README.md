# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

This project is about implementing additional functions and understanding nested loops in C. The main focus is to practice writing functions and following the Betty coding style.

## Task 0: isupper

Write a function that checks for uppercase character.

Prototype: `int _isupper(int c);`
- Returns `1` if `c` is uppercase
- Returns `0` otherwise
